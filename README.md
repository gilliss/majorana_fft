This project was done under the NCSSM Mentorship Program in the UNC Physics Department's ENAP group, advised by Sam Meijer, Tom Gilliss, and John Wilkerson.

FFT code used to analyze waveforms stored in ROOT files from the MAJORANA Demonstrator (can be generally used as long as waveforms are stored in ROOT files)
